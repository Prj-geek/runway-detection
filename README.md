Runway Detection Web App

A Streamlit-based web application for detecting runways and their orientation in aircraft landing images using a deep learning model.
🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for runway detection:

    Input: Aircraft landing images

    Output: Detected runway region, anchor points, and orientation overlayed on the image

    Model: U-Net-based segmentation model (TensorFlow/Keras)

    Interface: User-friendly web app built with Streamlit

✈️ Features

    Upload an aircraft landing image

    Visualize the detected runway and anchor points

    Display orientation and evaluation metrics (e.g., IOU score)

    Simple, interactive UI for demo and testing
